A Simple, Dynamic Web App Built on WebMatrix
============================================

This is the sample web site we build in the Hacking WebMatrix series on Tekpub. Bits include:

* Data Access with Massive
* Migrations with Manatee
* Clean up and Sweetening of C# with Sugar
* Testing with Quixote
* Exception Logging with ELMAH
* Logging Logging with NLog

This here app can be used as the start for any application you'd like to build. Have fun!
